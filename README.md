# SuperInstantiation
Automating the task of copying component details from instantiation files in Vivado. Program copies all components into main .vhd file. Some hard coded file paths are included to decrease runtime but there are ways around that.

To setup: change the file paths in the .pyw program to the appropriate ones for your project. Then set up the .bat file which when done can be simply run by pressing WIN+R and typing SI and hitting enter.
