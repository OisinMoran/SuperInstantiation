# SuperInstantiation
Automating the task of copying component details from instantiation files in Vivado. Program copies all components into main .vhd file. Some hard coded file paths are included to decrease runtime but there are ways around that.

To setup: change the top_filename and base variables in the .pyw program to the appropriate ones for your project. Then set up the .bat file. When complete the program can be simply run by pressing WIN+R, typing SI and hitting enter.
